**Author**: Mohammad Za'areer  
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
API server, which will provide data for the [City Explorer Application](https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide/curriculum/city-explorer-app/front-end/), allowing a user to search for a location, present a Map, as well as interesting information about the area.

## Getting Started
Install the required dependencies through 'npm install' command and then initialize the server on your local machine by 'node server.js'. after that, navigate to city explorer application address and provide it with the localhost url to get into the app and start quering it by location name.

## Architecture
The application built using Node.js and JavaScript.
